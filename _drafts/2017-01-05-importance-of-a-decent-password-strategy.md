Passwords are the main thing that protect your online valueables, be it your
emails, Facebook account, or your PayPal. Do you pay enough attention to the
strenght of your passwords and do you do everything possible to keep your
passwords secure?

In this post I'll explain why you need to think about your passwords, some of
the risks your passwords are exposed to, and describe my password strategy.

# Risks
We have passwords everywhere, your e-mail account, social media, web shops, you
name it. So what risks are these passwords exposed to?

## Weak passwords
The passwords could be weak. Anything found in a dictionary is a weak password,
anything under twelve characters is weak. Passwords can be guesed by attackers,
often in a automated process.

## Password reuse
Since we have entered passwords everywhere, we rely on the security of each and
website to keep our password safe. Unfortunately websites get hacked regurally.
Big names like [LinkedIn][1] and [Adobe][2] are among those hacked websites.

When a website is hacked and the attackers got their hands on the user data,
they could gain access to your email and password. The first thing attackers
will try is to login on your email, using the password that was leaked. If they
succeed the ramifications could be huge. Next they might try to login on
PayPal, if they succeed you can probably imagine what will happen next...

In order not having to rely on a third party to keep your password safe, we
need to have a unique password everywhere. I know, that might sound like a
nightmare, remembering douzens of unique passwords. Don't worry you end up
needing to remember only one password!

# Password managers
A password manager stores all your passwords in a safe manner. Password
managers come in two forms, an app that you install on your laptop or phone,
or in the form of a website offering this service. Using a password manager
requires you to remember one strong password, the password manager will
remember all your other passwords!

TODO: not think of new passwords -> generates new passwords.

[Lastpass][3] is a well known password manager website. Yes, when using a service
like Lastpass you put a lot of trust in that service. However it is their core
buisiness and they will work hard on keeping your passwords safe.

[Keepass][4] is an example of an application that you have to install for it to
manage your passwords. It stores your passwords in a single file. This file is
encrypted using your password (I should say passphrase, more on this later) so
using a strong password is essential. If someone gets their hands on your
Keepass file, he or she can not do anything with it, unless they know your
password.

# Strong password
I have talked about strong passwords and mentioned pass phrases.
